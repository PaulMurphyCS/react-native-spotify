//Change these values to quickly change the theme of the app, this is just an example, obviously there should be more thorough thought behind this

export const header = "#424242";
export const button = "white";
export const background = "#424242";
export const headerText = "whitesmoke";
export const buttonText = "#424242";
export const backgroundText = "whitesmoke";
